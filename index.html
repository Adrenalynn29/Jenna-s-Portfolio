    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
<p class= "larger-paragraph">Let me tell you a little about myself. I was born and raised near Denver, Colorado.
    I am currently pursuing a career as a software developer. Although, I have worked
many different jobs up to this point, I feel as though I have found something I can be
passionate about.</p>
<p class= "larger-paragraph">I have many skills that would be an asset to any team. I love working with others, and
    have excellent communications skills. From working since highschool, I have 
    developed a strong work ethic and take pride in my work.

<!--About me-->

<section class="center-text">
    <h2 id="about"> About me </h2> 
<div class="group">
<p>I have a Bachelors degree from Metropolitan State University. I went to school to become
    an elementary school teacher, but over time realized that it was not my passion.
Although working with kids was something I loved, I wanted to do something where I can create
things and use my critical thinking skills to solve issues, or make accomplishing certain
goals easier. As a software developer I can use many of the attibutes I have aquired
from working in different jobs.</p>
<p> From my expereince working in restaurants, I care about custromers and making
    sure that they have a pleasant experience and I am fantastic at working along the sides
    of my peers. From my education to become a teacher, I have learned how different types
of people work and what ways are best to help people access information. I learned how using
graphics can make information more approachable. I hope to be able to help clients de-bug their projects
or create websites for start-up businesses in a creative and innovative way. </p>
<p>When I am not working on coding, I enjoy doing several things. When the weather permits, I enjoy a nice
    ride on my yamaha R3. As a local girl to Colorado, I love being outdoors. I enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, riding my bike,
     and basically anything else you can do outside. I also enjoy playing video games, binging on tv shows, 
      or curling up and reading a book.
