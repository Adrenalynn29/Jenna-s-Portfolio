    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
<p1 class= "larger-paragraph">Let me tell you a little about myself. I was born and raised near Denver, Colorado.
    I am currently pursing a career as a software developer. Although, I have worked
many different jobs up to this point, I feel as though I have found something I can be
passionate about.</p1>
<p1 class= "larger-paragraph">I have many skills that would be an asset to any team. I love working with others, and
    have excellent communications skills. From working since highschool, I have 
    developed a strong work ethic and take pride in my work.

<!--About me-->
<section class="center-text">
    <h2><article id="about"> About me </article></h2>
<div class="group">
<p>I have a Bachelors degreegraduated from Metropolitan State University. I went to School to become
    and elementary school teacher, but over time realized that this was not my passion.
Although working with kids was something I loved, I wanted to do something where I can create
things and use my critical thinking skills to solve issues, or make accomplishing certain
goals easier. As a software developer I can use many of the attibutes I have aquired
from working in different jobs.</p>
<p> From my expereince working in restaurants, I care about custromers and making
    sure that they have a pleasant experience and I am fantastic at working along the sides
    of my peers. From my education to become a teacher, I have learned how different types
of people work and what ways are best to help people access information. I learned how using
graphics can make information more approachable. </p>
<p>When I am not working on coding, I enjoy doing several things. As a local girl to 
    Colorado, I love being outdoors. I enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, riding my motorcycle, riding my bike, and basically 
    anything else you can do outside. I also enjoy playing video games or curling up and
    reading a book.
